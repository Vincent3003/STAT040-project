# Intro to R & SAS Final Project
  This project is about comparing the average of total cases and the percentage of total average cases with the population in three different countries: China, USA, and Vietnam. 
I will calculate the cases in total, the average and percentage of total cases in those three countries to see the differences since they have three different populations. 
According to GitHub, there are 57,395 rows and 50 columns in that dataset. 
However, there are some of the rows and columns that will not be needed in this project, so I can cut out some unnecessary columns and rows to keep China, United States, and Vietnam.

  I worte this code because I wanted to be familiar with R coding programe at the beginning which is also my final project for Introduction to R & SAS class
