# Intro to R & SAS Final Project
  
  This project compares the number of Coronavirus cases and deaths in three countries: China, the USA, and Vietnam. 
I will calculate cases in total and the percentage of total cases in those three countries to see the differences since they have three different populations. According to GitHub, the dataset includes 57,395 rows and 50 columns. However, I can cut out some unnecessary columns and rows to keep China, the United States, and Vietnam.

  I wrote this code because I wanted to be familiar with the R coding program at the beginning, which is also my final project for Introduction to R & SAS class.
